#😂 Random Dad Joke Generator

This is a simple JavaScript project that fetches random dad jokes from the icanhazdadjoke API
and displays them on the page. It also includes a handy copy-to-clipboard feature so you can quickly share the jokes with friends.

✨ Features

Fetches a new random dad joke at the click of a button

Displays the joke dynamically in the browser

Copy jokes directly to your clipboard with one click

Uses the free icanhazdadjoke API

🛠️ How It Works

The "Get Joke" button triggers a function that fetches a random joke in JSON format from the API.

The joke is then displayed inside the #joke element.

The "Copy" button copies the current joke text to the clipboard using the modern navigator.clipboard API.

📂 Files

index.html → Contains the structure (buttons & joke container)

style.css → Styles for layout and design (optional/custom)

script.js → Core logic (fetching jokes & clipboard functionality)

🚀 Usage

Open the index.html file in your browser and start generating jokes instantly!
